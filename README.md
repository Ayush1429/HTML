# HTML
The following repository will contain any project that have been created solely using HTML (nothing else).
The projects may look ugly due to the lack of CSS and non-functional due to the lack of Javascript.
But the goal here is to create simple skeletons of popular websites and some which are completely new.
This will serve as a good practice for HTML skills.
